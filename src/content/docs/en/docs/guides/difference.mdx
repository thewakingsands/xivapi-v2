To save server resources, the XIVAPI service provided by FFCafe uses different update and storage methods.
As a result, some capabilities differ from the official XIVAPI service. The main differences are as follows:

<AnchorHeading id="language" level={3}>Supported Query Languages</AnchorHeading>

This service supports querying data in the following languages:

- Simplified Chinese `chs` (default/primary language)
- English `en`, German `de`, French `fr`, Japanese `ja`

Data is merged from the latest version of each client.

<AnchorHeading id="sheets" level={3}>Supported Sheet List</AnchorHeading>

This service does not support querying sheet data in subfolders (sheets with `/` characters in their names, mainly dialogue text).

<AnchorHeading id="game-versions" level={3}>Version Control</AnchorHeading>

This service does not currently support version control. All requests will use the latest version of data. The `version` parameter is invalid when querying sheet data.

<AnchorHeading id="assets" level={3}>Assets</AnchorHeading>

This service does not currently support asset requests. All related requests will return 404.
